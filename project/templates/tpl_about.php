                            <p>Shelter Me is a website that allows you to find or rehome a pet that needs a home. Our goal is simple: to help pets in need. 
                            Many endangered pets are able to have a new life once they're adopted, however there is a percentage of these that ends up abandoned. Adopting
                            a pet isn't just about saving a pet's life, but also about contributing towards the fight against pet abandoning.</p>

                            <p>We are not an association nor do we have pet shelters - throught the various posts made on our website we help endangered pets find someone 
                            who is able to give them the love and support they deserve, so they can a have a long and happy life.</p>
